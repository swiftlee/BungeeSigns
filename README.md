# BungeeSigns
Written by Gregz and SwiftLee. Is useable for RoyalMC_SpeedUHC and cross-server connectivity purposes. The SpeedUHC integration
allows for wool to be placed behind the sign to change color based on the game state as well as sign updates to include player count,
state of game, players left, and connectivity.
